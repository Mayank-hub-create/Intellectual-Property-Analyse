🧠 Intellectual Property Dashboard – A Data Analytics Project
This project focuses on analyzing Intellectual Property (IP) data to uncover trends in innovation, patent filings, and regional performance. It highlights my end-to-end data workflow — from raw data to storytelling — using tools like Excel, Power BI, and PowerPoint.

🔄 Project Workflow
🔍 Data Collection
→ Sourced public IP datasets (patents, trademarks, etc.) from reliable sources.

🧹 Data Cleaning & Validation
→ Removed duplicates, handled missing values, standardized categories.
→ Ensured data quality before analysis.

🔧 Data Transformation & Modeling
→ Created calculated columns and DAX measures.
→ Built KPIs like total filings, average growth, YoY changes.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
→ Identified top IP-filing countries, year-wise trends, and category breakdowns.

📈 Dashboard Design
→ Built an interactive Power BI dashboard with filters by year, country, and IP type.
→ Used cards, bar charts, donut charts, and slicers for user-friendly insights.

🗣 Storytelling & Presentation
→ Converted findings into a concise PowerPoint deck.
→ Focused on business-relevant insights and visual storytelling.
